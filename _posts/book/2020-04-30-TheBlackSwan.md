# A highly educative read on the impact of rare events

Nassim develops a theroy in each extremely rare events are the most impactful and that no models can proper prepare for them. Such events are called *Black Swans*.
The book is not easy to read but it has core concepts that I find extremely interesting. 

## Key events cannot be fully prepared for and that should be acknoledege
Limitation of models to predict

#### The example of the turkey for Thanksgiving perfectly illustrate such impacts


## Hard truth of the world divided into two - Extremistan & Mediocristan
To me, this is a core concept as it is a phenomeon we can clearly see in every part of today's society.
On one hand, *Mediocristan* is the land of Gaussian distribution were events are randomly predictable. This is well-illustrated with the distribution of height or weight within the population. Some are taller other smaller but the gaps is somehow contrained as someone will never exeed 3 meter. 
On the other, *Extremistan* is the land of power distribution and *Black Swans* occur. This is the case for salary inequalities were there is -sadly- no limit in the gaps between the richer and the poorer in a society.
With the two different worlds in mind, we can clearly make the connexion with jobs that are within the *Mediocristan* world versus in the *Extremistan*. Indeed, there is a stream of job that inherently belongs to *Extremistan* as there output are easy to duplicate. This is the case of engineer and poltics jobs, for which once the blueprint exists, it is there to be replicated.
