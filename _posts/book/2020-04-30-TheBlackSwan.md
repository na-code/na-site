# A highly educative read on the impact of rare events

Nassim develops a theroy in each extremely rare events are the most impactful and that no models can proper prepare for them. Such events are called *Black Swans*.
The book is not easy to read but it has core concepts that I find extremely interesting. 

## Key events cannot be fully prepared for and that should be acknoledege
Limitation of models to predict

#### The example of the turkey for Thanksgiving perfectly illustrate such impacts


## Hard truth of the world divided into two * - Extremistan and Mediocristan*
